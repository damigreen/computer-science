 * Concerning the registration is it possible to expose an API route that would allow us to register users on VampFI platform from our end? 
 * We already have data on our users so they won't need to fill any form and can just register on Vamp in one click from the Gatepass platform 
 * as against the manual registration where we need to download and send user data to VamFI.
 * 
 * ! Flows
 * data for users is inputed from app { name, email, address }
 * after processing from the app
 * 
 * they need to be logged in to make requests
