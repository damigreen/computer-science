## Quotes

> "Written things are not for speech; their form is literary; they are stiff, inflexible, and will not lend themselves to happy effective delivery with the tongue. Where their purpose is merely to entertain, not to instruct, they have to be limbered up, broken up, colloquialized, and turned into the common form of unpremeditated talk; otherwise they will bore the house—not entertain it." - Mark Twain

### Five laws of gold - richest man in babylon

1. Gold cometh *gladly* and in *increasing quantity* to any man who will put by not less than **one-tenth** of his **earrings** to create an estate for his future and that of his family.
2. Gold laboreth diligently and contentedly for the wise owner who finds for it profitable employment, multiplying even as the flocks of the field.
3. Gold clingeth to the protection of the cautious owner who invests it under the advice of men wise in its handling.
4. Gold slippeth away from the man who invests it in businesses or purposes with which he is not familiar or which are not approved by those skilled in its keep.
5. Gold flees the man who would force it to impossible earnings or who followeth the alluring advice of tricksters and schemers or who trusts it to his own inexperience and romantic desires in investment.

### Self confidence formula

#### First formula

I know that I have the **ability** to **achieve** the object of my Definite
Purpose in life, therefore, I **DEMAND** of myself **persistent, continuous action**
toward its attainment, and I here and now promise to render such action.

#### Second formula

I realize the dominating thoughts of my mind will eventually
reproduce themselves in outward, physical action, and gradually transform
themselves into physical reality, therefore, I will concentrate my thoughts for
thirty minutes daily, upon the task of thinking of the person I intend to
become, thereby creating in my mind a clear mental picture of that person.

#### Third formula

I know through the principle of auto-suggestion, any desire that I
persistently hold in my mind will eventually seek expression through some
practical means of attaining the object back of it, therefore, I will devote ten
minutes daily to demanding of myself the development of
SELFCONFIDENCE.

#### Fourth formula

I have clearly written down a description of my DEFINITE CHIEF
AIM in life, and I will never stop trying, until I shall have developed
sufficient self-confidence for its attainment.

#### Fifth formula

I fully realize that no wealth or position can long endure, unless built
upon truth and justice, therefore, I will engage in no transaction which does
not benefit all whom it affects. I will succeed by attracting to myself the
forces I wish to use, and the cooperation of other people. I will induce others
to serve me, because of my willingness to serve others. I will eliminate
hatred, envy, jealousy, selfishness, and cynicism, by developing love for all
humanity, because I know that a negative attitude toward others can never
bring me success. I will cause others to believe in me, because I will believe
in them, and in myself.
