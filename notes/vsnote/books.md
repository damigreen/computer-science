## Book Note

### The Quick and Easy Way To Effective Speaking

- Why do I believe this? When did I ever see this point exemplified in real life?
- What precisely am I trying to prove?
- Exactly how did it happen

### Greatest Salesman in the world

- I will Persist until I succeed
- I was not delivered into this world in defeat,
Nor does failure course in my veins
I am not a sheep waiting to be prodded by my shepherd, I am a lion and I refuse to walk, to talk, and to sleep with the sheep.
The slauther house of failure is not my destiny
I will persist until I succeed.
- Failure will never overtake me if my determination to succeed is strong enough
- Never will I my mind to be attracted to evil and despair, rather I will uplift it with the knowledge and wisdom of ages
- Never will I allow my soul to be complacent and satisfied, rather I will feed it with meditation and prayers.
- Never will I allow my heart to be small and bitter, rather I will share it and it will grow and warm the earth.
- I must fail often to succeed only once
- Henceforth I know that to court idleness is to steal food, clothing, warmth from those I love
- I will master my moods through positive actions and when I master my moods I will control my destiny.
- I will become master of myself, I will become great.

### Never Split the Difference

- When someone tells you “No,” you need to rethink the word in one of its alternative—and much more real—meanings:
  - I am not yet ready to agree;
  - You are making me feel uncomfortable;
  - I do not understand;
  - I don’t think I can afford it;
  - I want something else;
  - I need more information; or
  - I want to talk it over with someone else.
  
- Then, after pausing, ask solution-based questions or simply label their effect:
  - “What about this doesn’t work for you?”
  - “What would you need to make it work?”
  - “It seems like there’s something here that bothers you.”

- People have a need to say, “No.” So don’t just hope to hear it at some point; get them to say it early.
- good negotiators know that their job isn’t to put on a great performance but to gently guideh their counterpart to discover their goal as his own.
- “No” starts conversations and creates safe havens to get to the final “Yes” of commitment. An early “Yes” is often just a cheap, counterfeit dodge.

### On Writing - Stephen King

### Models - Mark Manson

- "Hi, my name is Bill, I thought you were very beautiful and wanted to say hi."
  Bill then sidles up next to her putting his arm halfway around her and begins to tell her a story of something that happened earlier in the night.
- When you say, "You’re cute and I wanted to meet you," that translates roughly to, "Hi, I want to be with you and am officially invested in the prospect of it happening."
- What gets women to cheat on their husbands is not meeting the most attractive man on the planet, but the removal of the friction between her life choices and yours.
- "Any individual who wants to be a leader has to be controversial.Otherwise they don’t stand for anything." - Richard M. Nixon, 37th President of the United States
- decide whatever you like in a woman by your own standards. If you like big girls or curvy girls, go for it. If you prefer black girls with readlocks, more power to you. If you like older women or younger women
- The way to tell if a woman is Unreceptive is if she does not reciprocate your signs of interest and shows signs of disinterest.
- The next category is Neutral. This category is kind of difficult for men to understand because we don’t really have it.
- And remember, showing your desire arouses women. Showing neediness turns them off.
- Typically, if guys have been friends with a girl for even a month or two without ever explicitly indicating their sexual interest in her, it’s usually too late.
- Guys also struggle a lot with the rejection, "I have a boyfriend." Guys seem to get obsessed about whether this is actually true or not.
- You have to polarize. It’s the name of the game. And getting good at the game is learning to open yourself up enough emotionally, learning to express your honest self enough and be comfortable enough with your vulnerability to take those embarrassing moments with the moments of passion.
- Remember women are turned on by men who desire them. They are also turned on by the behavior of high status.
- "I have failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed." - Michael Jordan, Athlete
- And polarizing women is more important than being pleasant to them.
- As with any failure, it’s not until you’ve been rejected a certain amount that you realize how insignificant it actually is.
- Remember, success here is defined by how fast we can sort through the women who won’t work for us, not our ability to get every single one we see 
- The catch? They don’t show up to your door-step in a FedEx box… as a man, you have to go out and find her.
- Each woman is a concoction of flavors, whipped together into her own unique personality and style Some of them will be interesting but not very good. Some of them we will love but will be bad for us. Others we’ll love and never want to stop drinking. The goal is to find that magical combination that we never want to stop drinking.
- Dating is random. It’s a slot machine made of women. Most men when they approach women, they approach thinking something like, "I hope she likes me," or "I hope she doesn’t embarrass me or reject me." It’s all about them.  
-The only truth about you is what you decide about yourself. And the more truth you know about yourself, the more you’ll be unaffected by others’ reactions to you and the more attractive you’ll become.
- If you just admit that you’re going to miss most of the time, then you can start shooting as much as you want.
- This is why we approach based on our truth. This is why we polarize women as soon as possible. This is why we approach women looking to see if she fits our values and needs and not the other way around.
- Instead of thinking, "I wonder if she’ll like me," think, "I wonder what she’s like?" Instead of thinking, "I hope she doesn’t reject me," think, "I wonder if we’ll have an adventure together?"  
- Success = Maximizing happiness with whichever woman/women we prefer
- The first way of expressing our truth involves developing a lifestyle that makes us happy. The second way of expressing truth is by being courageous and fighting through our fears and anxieties. And the third way of expressing truth is by communicating well and being uninhibited in our sexuality.
- The Three Fundamentals are: Creating an attractive and appealing lifestyle; Overcoming your fears and anxiety around women, and mastering the expression of your emotions and communicating fluidly.
- For short, I refer to the Three Fundamentals as: Honest Living, Honest Action, and Honest Communication.
- The more in-tune you are to your lifestyle, the more you take care of your appearance and your health, the higher quality of women you will attract and the greater percentage of Receptive women you’ll meet.
- if you see a beautiful woman and have a desire to meet her, to not take action and meet her is a form of dishonesty to yourself. You’re being needy and unable to expose your vulnerability

### 33 Strategies of War

- Look at things as they are, not as your emotions color them. In strategy you must see your emotional responses to events as a kind of disease that must be remedied. Fear will make you overestimate the enemy and act too defensively. Anger and impatience will draw you into rash actions that will cut off your options. Overconfidence, particularly as a result of success, will make you go too far. Love and affection will blind you to the treacherous maneuvers of those apparently on your side. Even the subtlest gradations of these emotions can color the way you look at events. Elevate yourself above the battlefield. In war, strategy is the art of commanding the entire military operation. Tactics, on the other hand, is the skill of forming up the army for battle itself and dealing with the immediate needs of the battlefield.
  
- But the greatest battle of all is with yourself--your weaknesses, your emotions, your lack of resolution in seeing things through to the end. You
must declare unceasing war on yourself

- To become a true strategist, you must take three steps. First, become aware of the weakness and illness that can take hold of the mind, warping its strategic powers. Second, declare a kind of war on yourself to make yourself move forward. Third, wage ruthless and continual battle on the enemies within you by applying certain strategies.

- Your mind is the starting point of all war and all strategy. A mind that is easily overwhelmed by emotion, that is rooted in the past instead of the present, that cannot see the world with clarity and urgency, will create strategies that will always miss the mark. To become a true strategist, you must take three steps. First, become aware of the weakness and illness that can take hold of the mind, warping its strategic powers. Second, declare a kind of war on yourself to make yourself move forward. Third, wage ruthless and continual battle on the enemies within you by applying certain strategies

- Do not listen to people who say that the distinction between friend and enemy is primitive and passe. They are just disguising their fear of conflict behind a front of false warmth. They are trying to push you off course, to infect you with the vagueness that inflicts them. Once you feel clear and motivated, you will have space for true friendship and true compromise. Your enemy is the polar star that guides you. Given that direction, you can enter battle. He that is not with me is against me. --Luke 11:23

- Danger is everywhere. There are always hostile people and destructive relationships. The only way to break out of a negative dynamic is to confront it. Repressing your anger, avoiding the person threatening you, always looking to conciliate--these common strategies spell ruin. Avoidance of conflict becomes a habit, and you lose the taste for battle. Feeling guilty is pointless; it is not your fault you have enemies. Feeling wronged or victimized is equally futile. In both cases you are looking inward, concentrating on yourself and your feelings. Instead of
internalizing a bad situation, externalize it and face your enemy. It is the only way out.

-What most often weighs you down and brings you misery is the past, in the form of unnecessary attachments, repetitions of tired formulas, and the memory of old victories and defeats. You must consciously wage war against the past and force yourself to react to the present moment. Be ruthless on yourself; do not repeat the same tired methods. Sometimes you must force yourself to strike out in new directions, even if they involve risk. What you may lose in comfort and security, you will gain in surprise, making it harder for your enemies to tell what you will do. Wage guerrilla war on your mind, allowing no static lines of defense, no exposed citadels -- make everything fluid and mobile.

- Never take it for granted that your past successes will continue into the future. Actually, your past successes are your biggest obstacle: every battle, every war, is different, and you cannot assume that what worked before will work today. You must cut yourself loose from the past and open your eyes to the present. Your tendency to fight the last war may lead to your final war.

- It is a disease to be obsessed by the thought of winning. It is also a disease to be obsessed by the thought of employing your swordsmanship. So it is to be obsessed by the thought of using everything you have learned, and to be obsessed by the thought of attacking. It is also a disease to be obsessed and stuck with the thought of ridding yourself of any of these diseases. A disease here is an obsessed mind that dwells on one thing. Because all these diseases are in your mind, you must get rid of them to put your mind in order. - TAKUAN, JAPAN, 1573-1645

- Understand: the greatest generals, the most creative strategists, stand out not because they have more knowledge but because they are able, when necessary, to drop their preconceived notions and focus intensely on the present moment. That is how creativity is sparked and opportunities are seized.

- Knowledge, experience, and theory have limitations: no amount of thinking in advance can prepare you for the chaos of life, for the infinite possibilities of the moment. The great philosopher of war Carl von. Clausewitz called this "friction": the difference between our plans and what actually happens. Since friction is inevitable, our minds have to be capable of keeping up with change and adapting to the unexpected. The better we can adapt our thoughts to changing circumstances, the more realistic our responses to them will be. The more we lose ourselves in predigested theories and past experiences, the more inappropriate and delusional our response. It can be valuable to analyze what went wrong in the past, but it is far more important to develop the capacity to think in the moment. In that way you will make far fewer mistakes to analyze. If you put an empty gourd on the water and touch it, it will slip to one side. No matter how you try, it won't stay in one spot. The mind of someone who has reached the ultimate state does not stay with anything, even for a second. It is like an empty gourd on the water that is pushed around. TAKUAN, JAPAN, 1573-1645

- superior strategists see things as they are. They are highly sensitive to dangers and opportunities. Nothing stays the same in life

-Relationships often develop a certain tiresome predictability. You do what you usually do, other people respond the way they usually do, and around it goes. If you reverse course, act in a novel manner, you alter the entire dynamic. Do this every so often to break up the relationship's stale patterns and open it to new possibilities.

- In moments of turmoil and trouble, you must force yourself to be more determined. Call up the aggressive energy you need to overcome caution and
inertia. Any mistakes you make, you can rectify with more energetic action still. Save your carefulness for the hours of preparation, but once the fighting begins, empty your mind of doubts. Ignore those who quail at any setback and call for retreat. Find joy in attack mode. Momentum will carry you through.

- Be self-reliant. There is nothing worse than feeling dependent on other people. Dependency makes you vulnerable to all kinds of otions--betrayal, disappointment, frustration--that play havoc with your mental balance.

- Lord Naoshige said, "When matters are done leisurely, seven out of ten will turn out badly. A warrior is a person who does things quickly."

- Being self-reliant is critical. To make yourself less dependent on others and so-called experts, you need to expand your repertoire of skills. And you need to feel more confident in your own judgment. Understand: we tend to overestimate other people's abilities--after all, they're trying hard to make it look as if they knew what they were doing--and we tend to underestimate our own. You must compensate for this by trusting yourself more and others less. 

- The Hara no aru hito [ man with  centre ] faces life calmly, is tranquil, ready for anything.... Nothing upsets him. The Hara no nai hito is the opposite of all this. The Hara no nai hito applies to the man without calm judgment. He lacks the measure which should be second nature. Therefore he reacts haphazardly and subectively, arbitrarily and capriciously. He cannot distinguish between important and unimportant, essential and unessential. Hara [ centre, belly ] is only in slight measure innate. It is above all the result of persistent self-training and discipline, in fact the fruit of responsible, individual development.  That is what the Japanese means when he speaks of the Hara no dekita hito , the man who has accomplished or finished his belly, that is, himself: for he is mature. If this development does not take place, we have the Hara no dekita inai hito, someone who has not developed, who has remained immature, who is too young in the psychological sense. The Japanese also say Hara no dekita inai hito wa hito no ue ni tatsu koto ga dekinai: the man who has not finished his belly cannot stand above others (is not fit for leadership). HARA: THE VITAL CENTRE , KARLFRIED GRAF VON DURCKHEIM, 1962

- You are your own worst enemy. You waste precious time dreaming of the future instead of engaging in the present. Since nothing seems urgent to you, you are only half involved in what you do. The only way to change is through action and outside pressure.

- Meditation on inevitable death should be performed daily. Every day when one's body and mind are at peace, one should meditate upon being ripped apart by arrows, rifles, spears and swords, being carried away by surging waves, being thrown into the midst of a great fire, bring struck by lightning, being shaken to death by a great earthquake, falling from thousand-foot cliffs, dying of disease or committing seppuku at the death of one's master. And every day without fail one should consider himself as dead. HAGAKURE: THE BOOK OF THE SAMURAI , YAMAMOTO TSUNETOMO, 1659-1720

- Sometimes you have to become a little desperate to get anywhere.

- Lord Naoshige said, "The Way of the Samurai is in desperateness. Ten men or more cannot kill such a man. Common sense will not accomplish great things. Simply become insane and desperate." HAGAKURE: THE BOOK OF THE SAMURAI , YAMAMOTO TSUNETOMO, 1659-1720

- If I do not die, if I am not killed, my life will suddenly seem endless, a whole eternity, each minute a century. I will take account of everything that passes--I will not waste a second of life again.

- His new motto was "Try to get as much done as possible in the shortest time."  

- Death is impossible for us to fathom: it is so immense, so frightening, that we will do almost anything to avoid thinking about it. Society is organized to make death invisible, to keep it several steps removed.

- While knowing that we will die someday, we think that all the others will die before us and that we will be the last to go. Death seems a long way off. Is this not shallow thinking? It is worthless and is only a joke within a dream.... Insofar as death is always at one's door, one should make sufficient effort and act quickly. --Hagakure: The Book of the Samurai, Yamamoto Tsunetomo (1659-1720)

- If our situation is easy and relaxed, if people are friendly and warm, our natural tension unwinds. We may even grow bored and tired;  

- Stake everything on a single throw. Act before you are ready.

- Death is nothing, but to live defeated is to die every day Enter new waters Make it "you against the world." Keep yourself restless and unsatisfied.  

- Under pressure your creativity will flourish. Do this often and you will develop your ability to think and act fast.

- Like Crawford, you sometimes have to force yourself onto death ground--leaving stale relationships and comfortable situations behind, cutting your ties to the past. If you give yourself no way out, you will have to make your new endeavor work.  

- A fighting spirit needs a little edge, some anger and hatred to fuel it. So do not sit back and wait for people to get aggressive; irritate and infuriate them deliberately.

- Take a risk and your body and mind will respond with a rush of energy. Make risk a constant practice; never let yourself settle down.

- Life has more meaning in the face of death. The risks you keep taking, the challenges you keep overcoming, are like symbolic deaths that sharpen your appreciation of life.

- Authority: When you will survive if you fight quickly and perish if you do not, this is called [death] ground....

- Authority: The value of a thing sometimes lies not in what one attains with it but in what one pays for it--what it costs us. --Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900)

-However desperate the situation and circumstances, don't despair. When there is everything to fear, be unafraid. When surrounded by dangers, fear none of them. When without resources, depend on resourcefulness. When surprised, take the enemy itself by surprise. --Sun-tzu, The Art of War (fourth century B.C.)

- And the best way to find the leader's weaknesses is not through spies but through the close embrace. Behind a friendly, even subservient front, u can observe your enemies, get them to open up and reveal themselves. Get inside their skin; think as they think. Once you discover their vulnerability--an uncontrollable temper, a weakness for the opposite sex, a gnawing insecurity--you have the material to destroy them.

- Finally, the enemy you are dealing with is not an inanimate object that will simply respond in an expected manner to your strategies. Your enemies are constantly changing and adapting to what you are doing. Innovating and inventing on their own, they try to learn from their mistakes and from your successes. So your knowledge of the enemy cannot be static. Keep your intelligence up to date, and do not rely on the enemy's responding the same way twice. Defeat is a stern teacher, and your beaten opponent today may be wiser tomorrow.

- In a world in which many people are indecisive and overly cautious, the use of speed will bring you untold power. Striking first, before your opponents have time to think or prepare, will make them emotional, unbalanced, and prone to error.  

- War is such that the supreme consideration is speed. This is to take advantage of what is beyond the reach of the enemy, to go by way of routes where he least expects you, and to attack where he has made no preparations.

- Blitzkrieg warfare, adapted for daily combat, is the perfect strategy for these times. While those around you remain defensive and immobile, you surprise them with sudden and decisive action, forcing them to act before they are ready. They cannot respond, as they usually do, by being elusive or cautious. They will most likely become emotional and react imprudently.You have breached their defenses, and if you keep up the pressure and hit them again with something unexpected, you will send them into a kind of downward psychological spiral--pushing them into mistakes, which further deepens their confusion, and so the cycle goes on.

- There will be times in life when you face a powerful enemy--a destructive opponent seeking your undoing, a slew of seemingly insurmountable problems hitting you at once. It is natural to feel intimidated in these situations, which may paralyze you into inaction or make you wait in the vain hope that time will bring a solution. But it is a law of war that by allowing the larger force to come to you, at full strength and unified,
you increase the odds against you; a large and powerful army on the move will gain an irresistible momentum if left unchecked. You will find yourself quickly overwhelmed. The wisest course is to take a risk, meet the enemy before it comes to you, and try to blunt its momentum by forcing or enticing it to divide. And the best way to make an enemy divide is to occupy the center.

### Richest Man in Babylon

- Our Prosperity as a nation depends on the personal financial prosperity of each of us as an individual Our acts can be no wiser than our thoughts. Our thinking can be no wiser than our understanding.

- Money is the medium by which earthly success is measured. Money makes possible the enjoyment of the best the earth affords. Money is plentiful for those who understand the simple laws which govern its acquisition. Money is governed today by the same laws which controlled it when prosperous men thronged the streets of Babylon, six thousand years ago. 'I found the road to wealth when I decided that a part of all I earned was mine to keep. And so will you.'

- 'Every gold piece you save is a slave to work for you. Every copper it earns is its child that also can earn for you. If you would become wealthy, then what you save must earn, and its children must earn, that all may help to give to you the abundance you crave.

- “Wealth, like a tree, grows from a tiny seed. The first copper you save is the seed from which your tree of wealth shall grow. The sooner you plant that seed the sooner shall the tree grow.  

- And next time if you would have advice about jewels, go to the jewel merchant. If you would know the truth about sheep, go to the herdsman. Advice is one thing that is freely given away, but watch that you take only what is worth having.

- "Arkad,” he continued, “you have learned your lessons well. You first learned to live upon less than you could earn. Next you learned to seek advice from those who were competent through their own experiences to give it. And, lastly, you have learned to make gold work for you.”

- Live otherwise according to your income and let not yourself get niggardly and afraid to spend. Life is good and life is rich with things worthwhile and things to enjoy."

- Budget  thy  expenses  that thou  mayest  have  coins  to  pay  for  thy  necessities,  to  pay  for  thy  enjoyments and  to  gratify  thy  worthwhile  desires  without  spending  more  than  ninetenths  of  thy  earnings."

- tell  you,  my  students,  a  man's  wealth  is  not  in  the  coins  he  carries  in  his purse;  it  is  the  income  he  buildeth,  the  golden  stream  that  continually floweth  into  his  purse  and  keepeth  it  always  bulging.

- my  training  would  show  to  me  at  once  the  folly  of  entrusting  a brick  maker  to  buy  jewels.

- Guard thy  treasure  from  loss  by  investing  only  where  thy  principal  is  safe,  where  it may  be  reclaimed  if  desirable,  and  where  thou  will  not  fail  to  collect  a  fair rental.  Consult  with  wise  men.  Secure  the  advice  of  those  experienced  in  the profitable  handling  of  gold.  Let  their  wisdom  protect  thy  treasure  from unsafe  investments."

- Own  thy  own  home

- Provide  in  advance  for  the needs  of  thy  growing  age  and  the  protection  of  thy  family."

- For  a  man  to  wish  to  be  rich is  of  little  purpose.  For  a  man  to  desire  five  pieces  of  gold  is  a  tangible  desire which  he  can  press  to  fulfillment.

- He  must  pay  his  debts  with  all  the  promptness  within  his  power,  not purchasing  that  for  which  he  is  unable  to  pay. "He  must  take  care  of  his  family  that  they  may  think  and  speak  well  of  him.   "He  must  make  a  will  of  record  that,  in  case  the  Gods  call  him,  proper  and honorable  division  of  his  property  be  accomplished. "He  must  have  compassion  upon  those  who  are  injured  and  smitten  by misfortune  and  aid  them  within  reasonable  limits.  He  must  do  deeds  of thoughtfulness  to  those  dear  to  him.  

- Thus  the  seventh  and  last  remedy  for  a  lean  purse  is  to  cultivate  thy  own powers,  to  study  and  become  wiser,  to  become  more  skillful,  to  so  act  as  to  respect  thyself.  Thereby  shalt  thou  acquire  confidence  in  thy  self  to  achieve thy  carefully  considered  desires.  

- Few  players  realize  how  certain  are  the  game  keeper's  profits  and how  uncertain  are  their  own  chances  to  win. She  thinks  if  a  man  desires  to  be  lucky  he  will  step  quick

- So must every man master his own spirit of procrastination before he can expect to share in the rich treasures of Babylon

- Dost agree with me that no man can arrive at a full measure of success until he hath completely crushed the spirit of procrastination within him?"

- From our discussion have I learned that to attract good luck to oneself, it is necessary to take advantage of opportunities. Therefore, in the future, I shall endeavor to make the best of such opportunities as do come to me."

- "Those eager to grasp opportunities for their betterment, do attract the interest of the good goddess.  She is ever anxious to aid those who please her.Men of action please her best.

- "Action will lead thee forward to the successes thou dost desire."

- "Gold is reserved for those who know its laws and abide by them."

- I wish that thou go out into the world and show thy ability both to acquire gold and to make thyself respected among men.

#### THE FIVE LAWS OF GOLD

1. Gold cometh gladly and in increasing quantity to any man who will put by not less than one-tenth of his earrings to create an estate for his future and that of his family.

2. Gold laboreth diligently and contentedly for the wise owner who finds for it profitable employment, multiplying even as the flocks of the field.

3. Gold clingeth to the protection of the cautious owner who invests it under the advice of men wise in its handling.

4. Gold slippeth away from the man who invests it in businesses or purposes with which he is not familiar or which are not approved by those skilled in its keep.

5. Gold flees the man who would force it to impossible earnings or who followeth the alluring advice of tricksters and schemers or who trusts it to his own inexperience and romantic desires in investment.

I realize the dominating thoughts of my mind will eventually
reproduce themselves in outward, physical action, and gradually transform
themselves into physical reality, therefore, I will concentrate my thoughts for
thirty minutes daily, upon the task of thinking of the person I intend to
become, thereby creating in my mind a clear mental picture of that person.

##### Third formula

I know through the principle of auto-suggestion, any desire that I
persistently hold in my mind will eventually seek expression through some
practical means of attaining the object back of it, therefore, I will devote ten
minutes daily to demanding of myself the development of
SELFCONFIDENCE.

##### Fourth formula

I have clearly written down a description of my DEFINITE CHIEF
AIM in life, and I will never stop trying, until I shall have developed
sufficient self-confidence for its attainment.

##### Fifth formula

I fully realize that no wealth or position can long endure, unless built
upon truth and justice, therefore, I will engage in no transaction which does
not benefit all whom it affects. I will succeed by attracting to myself the
forces I wish to use, and the cooperation of other people. I will induce others
to serve me, because of my willingness to serve others. I will eliminate
hatred, envy, jealousy, selfishness, and cynicism, by developing love for all
humanity, because I know that a negative attitude toward others can never
bring me success. I will cause others to believe in me, because I will believe
in them, and in myself.

#### Practical Steps for DESIRE for riches

##### First step

Fix in your mind the exact amount of money you desire. It is not
sufficient merely to say "I want plenty of money." Be definite as to the
amount. (There is a psychological reason for definiteness which will be
described in a subsequent chapter).

##### Second step

Determine exactly what you intend to give in return for the money
you desire. (There is no such reality as "something for nothing.)

##### Third step

Establish a definite date when you intend to possess the money you
desire.

##### Fourth step

Create a definite plan for carrying out your desire, and begin at once,
whether you are ready or not, to put this plan into action.

##### Fifth step

Write out a clear, concise statement of the amount of money you
intend to acquire, name the time limit for its acquisition, state what you
intend to give in return for the money, and describe clearly the plan through
which you intend to accumulate it.

##### Sixth

Read your written statement aloud, twice daily, once just before
retiring at night, and once after arising in the morning. AS YOU READ—
SEE AND FEEL AND BELIEVE YOURSELF ALREADY IN
POSSESSION OF THE MONEY.

#### Instructions for Practical Steps for DESIRE for riches

##### First Instruction

Go into some quiet spot (preferably in bed at night) where you will not
be disturbed or interrupted, close your eyes, and repeat aloud, (so you may
hear your own words) the written statement of the amount of money you
intend to accumulate, the time limit for its accumulation, and a description of
the service or merchandise you intend to give in return for the money. As you
carry out these instructions, SEE YOURSELF ALREADY IN POSSESSION
OF THE MONEY.

"By the first day of January, 20.., I will have in my possession $150,000,
which will come to me in various amounts from time to time during the
interim.
"In return for this money I will give the most efficient service of which I am
capable, rendering the fullest possible quantity, and the best possible quality
of service in the capacity of salesman of …(describe the service or
merchandise you intend to sell).
"I believe that I will have this money in my possession. My faith is so strong
that I can now see this money before my eyes. I can touch it with my hands.
It is now awaiting transfer to me at the time, and in the proportion that I
deliver the service I intend to render in return for it. I am awaiting a plan by
which to accumulate this money, and I will follow that plan, when it is
received."

##### Second Instruction

Repeat this program night and morning until you can see, (in your
imagination) the money you intend to accumulate.

##### Third Instruction

Place a written copy of your statement where you can see it night and
morning, and read it just before retiring, and upon arising until it has been
memorized.

production, return, etc..)

- “I know that _______, heck if you were interested you’d have called me! But seriously, I know you get a lot of calls, and every now and then it makes sense to listen to the right call, and this is it.” (Now (continue on with your presentation))

- “________ you probably get a lot of these calls, don’t you? You know, I get them, too, and believe me, I don’t like getting them any more than you do. But every now and then I listen because sometimes I there’s some information out there that will benefit me. And this is that kind of call for you.

- “Sure, and after you review it, how soon are you going to make a decision on it?"

- “And what would you need to see to say yes to it?"

#### Reflex Response #3: “We’re already taken care of.”

- “I’m glad you’re taken care of right now. _______, let me ask you something. If you ever found it necessary to get another (quote, point of view, find another vendor, information, etc.), could I be the first one in line to talk to you about some of your needs?

- “Great. I’ll go ahead and send you some of my contact information; do me a favor and keep it with your (similar) records so you’ll have it handy if you need some help with (your product or service).”

You see the companies that use us as well have found that they can increase their (pitch your benefits here) by X%.  "And to see if this will work for you as well, let me
just ask you a couple of quick questions...(now qualify for interest, control, and budget).

“_______, I know you get a lot of these calls and heck I don’t like making them any more than you like getting them. But the truth is, this is the one call this month that is worth you taking 5 minutes to participate in. Let me ask you…(ask a good, benefits filled qualifying question here).

#### “I’m Too Busy to Talk to You Right Now.”

##### The “Invest Minutes” Script

I appreciate how important time is to you. You’ll be pleased to dis-
cover that our [your product/service] will save you time and money. If
you can invest just [number] minutes, I can help you save [$x]. That’s
a fair exchange, isn’t it?

I understand your concern for time, but are you too busy to increase
your profit margin?

##### The “Short Presentation” Script

Other people in your [industry/business/field] have told me exactly the
same thing. And so I invested my time to shorten my presentation so
it takes no more than [number] minutes of your time. Let’s share those
few minutes together. You’ll find that your investment in those few
minutes was a very wise decision.

##### The “Demonstrate Profits” Script

You know, [Mr./Ms. Prospect], that others in your [industry/busi-
ness/field] have answered exactly as you just did before I had the
chance to sit down with them and demonstrate how our [your prod-
uct/service] would increase their profits. I wonder if we might meet.
Don’t pause here.
Would [day] at [time] be good, or is [another day/time] better?

##### The “Wise Decision” Script

You know [Mr./Ms. Prospect], a lot of people have said that. But once
I had the opportunity to meet with them and share how our [your
product/service] would help them, they made the wise decision to
give us a try. My calendar indicates that [day] at [time] is clear. Or is
[another day/time] better?

##### The “Takes Longer to Read” Script

*Don’t use this if you’re less interesting than a piece of paper!*
I’d send you information in the mail, but it would take longer for you
to read it than for me to explain it. And I’m so much more interesting
and effective than a piece of paper. If time is really of the essence to
you, let’s talk face to face. That will save you time.

#### “You’re Wasting Your Time.”

##### The “Appreciate Thoughtfulness” Script

Thanking the prospect for showing concern is disarming.
I appreciate your thoughtfulness. I understand the value of time too.
And that’s why I think it’s critical we get together for fifteen minutes.
What I have to share with you could significantly affect your com-
pany’s profit and productivity. Could you free up fifteen minutes on
[day] or is [another day] better?

#### “I’m Not Interested.”

##### The “Just Those Words” Script

*Say assuredly:*
Many of our loyal customers began our relationship with just those
words. It wasn’t until I demonstrated how [your product/service] could
help increase the bottom line that they became really interested. I’ll
share that same information with you now.

##### The “Company’s Interests” Script

*Be surprised.*
How come? You are concerned about your company’s interests,
aren’t you?

Does saving money interest you? Does improving productivity inter-
est you? Does cutting down on problems interest you? If you answer
yes to any of these, then you need to learn how we can help.

##### The “Not Today” Script

*First, speak understandingly; then sound confused.*
If you’re not interested today, I understand. If you think you’ll never be
interested, then I’m confused. I thought you were in business to make
money and increase profits and productivity. That is true, isn’t it?

##### The “Until I Demonstrate” Script

*Say matter-of-factly:*
I understand. Until I demonstrate for you how [your product/service]
will help increase profits and improve performance, I wouldn’t expect
you to be interested. I just need fifteen minutes to explain how we can
deliver results.
We could get together [day] at [time], or is [another day] at [time]
better?

##### The “Never Hear That” Script

*Be astonished!*
We hardly ever hear that. Could you explain how you could not be in-
terested in increasing [profits/morale/productivity]? I thought that was
a key goal.

##### The “Good Reason” Script

I’m sure you have a good reason for saying that. Please share it
with me.

#### “The Price Is Far Too High.”

Insist on specificity from your prospect.
What are you comparing our offering price to?

The script begins with affirmation.
Price is an important consideration, isn’t it? Would you consider value
equally important? Let me tell you about the value of our products.

What price were you planning on paying?

We can lower the price.
*This next question arouses discontent.*
What options would you like to eliminate from the package?

We agree, then, that price is not the only consideration in making a
purchase decision. The value of what you get counts too, doesn’t it?
Let’s talk about the values that [your product/service] brings with it.

I think you’d agree that quality is more costly. Is quality important
to you?

Our price is high. But it’s not high enough when you consider the
“total package” we provide.

I appreciate your honesty. If we can resolved the cost to your satis-
faction, then would you want to purchase it today?

“Other than the money, is there anything else that’s pre-
venting you from moving forward?”

You’re obviously a person who appreciates value. Why are you hesi-
tating to buy what you need now? Would you seek the services of an
attorney who charged $5 an hour or a surgeon who charged a flat fee
of $100 per procedure?
Why would you want to scrimp on quality now? Your company de-
serves the best [product/service] available.

I appreciate your honesty. If we can resolved the cost to your satis-
faction, then would you want to purchase it today?

I appreciate your honesty. If we can resolved the cost to your satis-
faction, then would you want to purchase it today?

Price concerns you today. Quality concerns you every day. Aren’t you
better off paying a little more than you expected rather than a lot less
than you need to ensure quality?

Price concerns you today. Quality concerns you every day. Aren’t you
better off paying a little more than you expected rather than a lot less
than you need to ensure quality?

Is it the price or the cost that concerns you? You see, you pay the
price only once—when you purchase. Cost, however, is of concern
for as long as you [own/use] the [product/service]. You might find a
lower price out there; you won’t find a lower cost.

A year from now price won’t concern you if [your product/service]
lives up to your expectations. However, even if you pay less, you’ll
constantly be reminded of the cost of poor performance, inferior ser-
vice, or lack of quality. It ends up being what you paid for.

#### “We Have Decided Not to Buy the Product/Service from You.”

May I ask why?

What changed your mind?

Who did you decide to go with?
They are a good company, but, of course, we feel we are better be-
cause [ your company’s benefit].
I’m sure that there is still time to change your mind, isn’t there?

What caused you to make that decision? Obviously, I failed to get my
message across. Could you share with me where I went wrong?

Today or ever? “Today” I can reluctantly accept. “Forever” leaves
me very disturbed. It was my impression that helping your company
effectively prepare for the future was a top priority, and I am fully
committed to helping you accomplish that. What is keeping that
from happening?

[Mr./Ms. Prospect], I see you feel quite strongly about this, so there
must be a reason for your feeling as you do. I’d appreciate it if you’d
share that reason with me.

#### “Times Are Tough.”

That makes this the perfect time to talk. Our [ your product/service]
is designed to help companies like yours get through the tough
times.

Our [ your product/service] will improve your situation.

We couldn’t agree more that the economy is making times tough for
everyone—even us!
In fact, we have designed the pricing of our [products/services] to
minimize the negative impact of these times and actually reduce your
cost basis.

[Your product/service] can help you meet the challenges that tough
times present you with. It’s important for you to emerge from today’s
challenges stronger, isn’t it?

#### “We Feel We Must Be Loyal to Our Current Supplier.”

I respect your sense of loyalty to my competitor. I believe in loyalty as
well. I think that your first loyalty should be to the well-being of your
own company, don’t you?

If I can show you that our [product/service] is better for your company
than the one you are currently using, you would consider changing, or
at least sampling ours, wouldn’t you?

Would it be worth the change in loyalty for a [cost reduction/increase
in morale/increase in productivity]?

Do you ever make exceptions? Just suppose we could [improve prof-
its/boost productivity/reduce turnover], you would want to consider
us then, wouldn’t you?

Is there anything about your present situation you’re not totally happy
with? Just suppose our [ your product/service] could eliminate that
problem. It would be worth considering then, wouldn’t it?

Some of our best customers today used to use our competition yes-
terday. Let me tell you why they switched to us.

I understand. But why not give us a try on a small [order/job]? Check
us out and see how we can benefit you.

That’s just about what every one of my present customers told me the
first time I called. Why do you suppose that I count them among my
best customers now?

#### “We Want to Think It Over.”

Great! What do we need to think about?

Fine. I’ll just make a phone call while you folks talk it over, and then I’ll
be right back to answer any question you may have.

Why do you need to invest even more time in making this decision?

### Sales Script Mastery

I. Transition into the close
II. Body of the close
A. Name of program
B. What is included

0. Greeting identifying who I am
1. Explaining the reason for the conversation
2. Explaining what I’d like to do during the appointment
3. Asking the prospect if they’d like to meet
4. Hello, this is . . . I’m calling for . . . Is this . . . ?
To apply this template, I use language such as this:
5. The reason I’m calling is . . .
6. What I’d like to do is . . . How it works is . . .
7. How do you feel about scheduling an appointment? . . . I am open
on . . . What works best for you? Would you like to schedule an

appointment?

“How do you feel about moving forward?”
“I don’t have the money.”
“Other than the money, is there anything else that’s pre-
venting you from moving forward?”
“Well, it’s actually not the money. It’s my husband.”
“Tell me more about that.”
“Well, I bought a program similar to this a few years ago
without first talking it over with my husband. The program
didn’t work and we were out several thousands dollars, and
my husband was very upset with me. I’m concerned that if
I buy this program tonight, my husband might be unhappy
with me.”
“I understand. So you want to find out how your husband
feels about this before you make an investment in the
program?”
“Exactly.”
“Let me ask you a question—is your husband home
tonight?”
“Yes.”
“Let’s put him on the line and I will share with him that you
have an interest in the program and that you want to hear if
he has any concerns before moving forward. How does that
sound?”
“I can do that.”
[The woman’s husband joined the conversation.]
“Sir, I was talking with your wife who is very interested in
one of our programs. This is what the program is. It costs
$6,000. She said that you both had a bad experience before
and she don’t want to do anything without you first know-
ing what she was doing and secondly, that you felt that that
was a good decision. We wanted to know how you feel
about this?”
