## Mind Notes

divide your thinking into sections by labelling them using `titles`, `sections` 
and `points`. Come up with others later on when you have **applied** the first two keywords in
organizing and struturing your thougths using the right `titles` however the
case my be.
    Create hierarchies for the titles and points.
start by using the chronological method for grouping every `title` section

    **for instance**
    the first hierarchy which is **title: Angular tutorial by mosh**
    - angular tutorial by mosh
      - introduction to typescript

        when to retrieve your thoughs, Go back to the begining of the last statment
